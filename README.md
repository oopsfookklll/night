# Night - Selenium Bing Search

This Python script uses Selenium to automate searches on Bing for a place to eat dinner and a movie to watch at 11pm, and returns the first result for each search.

## Functionality

The script performs the following steps:
1. Opens a new Firefox browser window using Selenium WebDriver.
2. Navigates to the Bing website.
3. Performs a search for "place to eat dinner".
4. Prints the title of the first search result.
5. Performs a search for "movie to watch at 11pm".
6. Prints the title of the first search result.
7. Closes the browser window.

## Requirements

To run this script, you will need:
* Python 3
* Selenium WebDriver
* Firefox browser
* Geckodriver

## Expected Changes

The code should be updated to perform the following additional tasks:
* Add error handling to manage situations where no search results are found.
* Improve the search functionality to return more relevant results.
* Optimize the code for better performance and efficiency.
